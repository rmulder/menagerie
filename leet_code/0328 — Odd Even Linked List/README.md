## 328. Odd Even Linked List

Given a singly linked list, group all nodes together followed by the even nodes. Please note here we are talking about the node number and not the value in the nodes.

You should try try to do in place. THe program should run O(1) space complexity and O(nodes) time complexity.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 1->2->3->4->5->NULL
Output: 1->3->5->2->4->NULL
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 2->1->3->5->6->4->7->NULL
Output: 2->3->6->7->1->5->4->NULL
```
