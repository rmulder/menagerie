## 590. N-ary Tree Postorder Traversal

Given an n-ary tree, return the _postorder_ traversal of its nodes' values.

For example, given a `3-ary` tree:

![N-ary tree](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/12/narytreeexample.png)

Return its postorder traversal as: `[5,6,3,2,4,1]`.

**Note:**

Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?
