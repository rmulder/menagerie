## 647. Palindromic Substrings

Given a string, your task is to count how many palindromic substrings there are in this string.

The substrings with different start indices or end indices are counted as different substrings even if they consist of the same characters.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: Three palindromic strings: "a", "b", "c".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: "aaa"
Output: 6
Explanation: Six palindromic strings: "a", "a", "a", "aa", "aa", "aaa".
```

**Note:**

1. The input string length won't exceed 1000.
