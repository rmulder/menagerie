## 11. Container With Most Water

Given _n_ non-negative integers _a1, a2, ..., an_, where each represents a point at coordinate (_i, ai_). _n_ vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line _i_ is at (_i, ai_) and (_i_, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

**Note:** You may not slant the container and _n_ is at least 2.
